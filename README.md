# help-on-web
This is an urgent request for help.  I feel not intelligent. Please advise with basic stuff..
I asm attempting to follow instructions on setting up a website. 
Cut and paste their code and see if it loads and say what it is meant to - these are tests.
Creste your folder and in text editor create a file called index.html.
Done that many times.  Some work, some don't.  Had code of working and not working side by side 
Don't get it.
Tests do not work.
It says to insert their code into index.html.
Csn't past or asnything.
So I do it in editor and save to index.
Does not work consistently.
I took the folders off read only.
on or off doesn't matter.
I know it is likely simple but not getting it at all.
So please someone wise please advise.
